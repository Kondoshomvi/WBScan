       <b>\nWhat this app can do:</b>
                \n\n This app can scan nearby wireless access points and can provide some information
                about them. Also, this app can be used for localizing APs based on signal strength.
                \n\n<i>(notice that the signal strength is reduced by obstacles and radio noise, so in most of
                the cases the APs are closer than the estimation)</i>
                \n\n The bluetooth part of the app will provide just a detailed list of the discoverable
                bluetooth devices, without the localization feature seen on wifi scan.
        <b>\n\n What this app can\'t do:</b>
                \n\n The app does not provide at this point any connectivity related options, so you cannot
                connect to other devices using this app, although this might change in the future.

        <b>\n\n Tip:</b>
                \n\n Use the exit button (from the menu) to turn off Wifi and Bluetooth when you finnish.
                \n (only if Wifi or Bluetooth was enabled by this app)

        \n\n For any suggestions, or for reporting a bug, please contact me at:
        \n\n Thanks.
